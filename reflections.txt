You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Since I'm returning not only to web development, but also returning to this program to complete a nanodegree that I already started, I've been exposed to these concepts before.  However, I did find that things have changed in a few ways since I last looked over the documentation for HTML on the Mozilla Developer's Network.  The documentation is more robust and there is more detail and a new way to navigate the site.  This was all new to me.

Since I'm experienced in programming this material was very simple for me.

However, that being said, I did find it a bit confusing when I went to go use the <em>, <b> and the <strong> tags.  They are all related and seem to do the same thing, but after reviewing the MDN docs about it I found that there are subtile differences of which I was not aware.  That actually I found a little difficult!

Documentation is a wonderful gift to developers and I used the great documentation on the internet to answer my questions.  I hope I got it right as I added tags to the Humans vs Machines text!
